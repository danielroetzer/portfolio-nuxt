      "nuxt": "I decided to use Nuxt.js, because it makes the build process really easy and uses Vue.js. Furthermore, Nuxt lets you create server side rendered applications, which is a huge benefit for SEO. In addition, there is an option to export your website as a static generated Vue application, which greatly improves performance.",

Once setup, Netlify automatically deploys my project from the master branch in my GitLab repository. I simply push changes to the master branch and Netlify does the rest."
